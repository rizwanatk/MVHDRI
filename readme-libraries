# Preliminary guidelines towards the implementation of A High Dynamic Range Imaging Method for Short
Exposure Multiview Images.

#Extract and copy all codes in the laerning base restoration code folder.
#Apply Geometric transformation
#Use SIFT-Method for feature extraction.
#Once feature are axtracted estimate brightness difference among the adjacent viewpoints.
#Start restoration process based on optimal contrat tonemaooing through learning based restoration
#Construct HDR by using restored Multiview LDR Images. Use Debvec and Malik Fundamental Method for HDR recovery. 
#Apply Tonemapping to produce LDR Images
#Directly Fuse the Reconstructed MV-LDR images and Produce high dynamic range images with out tonemapping.
